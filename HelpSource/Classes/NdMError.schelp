class:: NdMError
categories:: NdM
summary:: Error type for invalid NdM usage and specification violations.

DESCRIPTION::
NdMError represents errors specific to NdM and NdMSpace operation.

It is raised when:
list::
## Invalid output bus specifications are provided
## Mixed-rate buses are used where not allowed
## Unsupported values are passed to NdM or NdMSpace APIs
## Internal consistency checks fail
::

NdMError is intended to clearly distinguish NdM-specific failures
from generic SuperCollider errors.
